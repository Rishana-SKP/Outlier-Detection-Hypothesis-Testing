    "Hypothesis testing is a fundamental statistical method used to make inferences about population parameters based on sample data. It involves formulating two competing hypotheses: the null hypothesis (H0), which typically states that there is no effect or no difference between groups, and the alternative hypothesis (H1), which asserts the presence of an effect or difference. The process generally entails selecting an appropriate statistical test based on the nature of the data and the research question, calculating a test statistic from the sample data, and determining the probability of obtaining such results under the assumption that the null hypothesis is true, known as the p-value. If the p-value is below a predetermined significance level (usually 0.05), the null hypothesis is rejected in favor of the alternative hypothesis, suggesting evidence for the presence of an effect or difference. Otherwise, if the p-value is above the significance level, the null hypothesis is not rejected. Hypothesis testing provides a systematic framework for drawing conclusions from data, aiding researchers in making informed decisions and drawing valid inferences about the population."
